        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936) is an American computer scientist, systems engineer and business owner. She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo space program. She later founded two software companies—Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty projects and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term "software engineering".</p>
        <p>On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.</p>

    <!-- <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <p>On July 20, 1969 the Apollo 11 astronauts succeeded in their goal, landing with near-flawless precision. Shortly after, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took humanity’s first historic steps on another world. And if you aren’t aware, Margaret Hamilton is the engineer who got us there. She took humanity to the Moon.</p>
    <p>Hamilton wrote the code for Apollo 11’s on-board flight software, and as a result of her work, she received NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award. If that’s not enough, she is also credited with coining the term “software engineering.”</p> -->

<!-- Why I admire them? She was the woman who coded humans to the moon, what I REALLY admire about Margaret is that she proves that women and diversity in general is needed in an industry that solves real world problems. Diversity encourages different opinions and different ways of solving problems. -->
<!-- Something that I probably don't already know about them? she coined the term "Software Engineering" -->
