# Anagram Detector
Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the anagrams of the given word.

In other words, given: ``"listen"`` and ``["enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana"]`` the program should return ``"inlets"``.

## Suggestions
Start out by getting this working with discrete functions.
If you feel comfortable with that, try to put all your functions, collections, etc, into an object.
