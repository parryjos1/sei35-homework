## Warmup - Serge Says

## Examples
* Serge answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

* He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).

* He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

* He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

* Create a function that takes an input and returns Serge's response.
