# Happy Numbers

A happy number is defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer,
- Replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and
repeat the process until
- the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
- or it loops endlessly in a repeating cycle which does not include 1.

Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those for which this process do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

## Task
Your task is to write a program in Javascript which prints the first 10 happy numbers, starting from 1.

Here are the first 10 happy numbers, for you to compare your output against:
```
1
7
10
13
19
23
28
31
32
44
```
