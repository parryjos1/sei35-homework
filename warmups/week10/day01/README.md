# Prime Factors
A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is any number greater than one that is only divisible by itself.

- 1 is not a prime number (it is not greater than 1).
- 2 is a prime number (it is greater than one and is only evenly divisible by itself and 1).
- 3 is a prime number (as above).
- 4 is not a prime number (it is evenly divisible by 2).
The [prime factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number#Unique_factorization) of an integer are the set of prime numbers that will divide the integer exactly.

## Example
What are the prime factors of 60?

- 1 is not a prime number.
- 2 is a prime number. 60 is evenly divisible by 2 (therefore 2 is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 30.
- 30 is evenly divisible by 2 (therefore 2 is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 15.
- 15 is not evenly divisible by 2.
- 3 is the next prime number. 15 is evenly divisible by 3 (therefore 3 is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 5.
- 4 is not a prime number.
- 5 is a prime number. 5 is evenly divisible by 5 (therefore 5 is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 1.
- When we get to 1, we're done.
- The prime factors of 60 are **2, 2, 3, 5**
You can check this yourself:

- 2 * 2 * 3 * 5
- = 4 * 15
- = 60
- Success!
